# Main ideas
## Doppler explains everything
* Doppler explain MM experiment
* Doppler explains Figure 5 of An's Research Gate

## Gravity as Dielectric
* There seems to be a medium that support light waves.
* The medium seems to be affected by energy density
  * in particular, gravitational energy density
  * gravity can be seen as a dielectric as per Maxwell eqs
    * dielectric constant K seems to be p^2 where p is energy density of space;
    * $c = c_o/\sqrt{p^2}$
    * $p = p* + p_{earth} + p_{moon} + ...$
    * however a hypothesis is to instead use the Barycenter of the Solar System to calculate gravitational influence from the center of mass
      * see [Is it possible to calculate the barycenter of a planet with several moons](https://qr.ae/ps6SQe)
        * (this should be already available)

## we just need to convince ourselves
It is indeed difficult to convince the community as a whole since many (not all) are more interested in proving us wrong than to help us being right.

Others don't see it.

Other don't believe us, and they don't have to.

There should be a simple principle or effect that could prove first to us, withough a shred of doubt, the next logical step.

See for example (electro-magetic-compass-keychain)[(#electro-magetic-compass-keychain)

# next steps

## analyze frequencies of data

# Pet Projects:

## Electro Magnetic Compass keychain
I was thinking in a floating needle in the middle of a container.
    - The density of the fluid could be adjusted to allow free rotation of the needle (need to think what would cause this force... :/ );
    - since it's floating it might be super sensitive to gravity; the liquid should allow very easy movement with almost any resistance;
    - probably we can support the needle on one of its ends, and let it float at an angle;
    - the angle should change if we make it right.

## Energy generation using our movement relative to the medium

## Energy generation using the hypothesis that light speed changes with a dielectric medium as gravity

## Casimir-force-driven motor (force felt by to parallel conducting plantes when brought close to each other)
* we don't necessarily need to know the oscillation function, any oscillation could be useful if designed like a `check valve` or diode
* casimir's force seems to be proportional to energy density
* energy density varies as the Barycenter (solar system, earth-moon) moves around us
  * calculate coordinates of barycenter and fit to plots
    * earth-moon
    * earth-sun-moon

## measure one-way speed of light
* we can use Intensity of power measured as a proxy to distance traveled by light , $\displaystyle I \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$
* intensity can be measured consecutively at the receiver's end, it should drop as $1/r^2$; can one way speed of light be inferred this way?

## Use 3b1b's library to do simulations of our measurements
