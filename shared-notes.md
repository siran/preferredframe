# Main ideas
## Doppler explains everything
* Doppler explain MM experiment
* Doppler explains Figure 5 of An's Research Gate

## Gravity as Dielectric
* There seems to be a medium that support light waves.
* The medium seems to be affected by energy density
  * in particular, gravitational energy density
  * gravity can be seen as a dielectric as per Maxwell eqs
    * dielectric constant K seems to be p^2 where p is energy density of space;
    * $c = c_o/\sqrt{p^2}$
    * $p = p* + p_earth + p_moon + ...$
    * however a hypothesis is the instead use the Barycenter of the Solar System

## we just need to convince ourselves
It is indeed difficult to convince the community as a whole since many (not all) are more interested in proving us wrong than to help us being right.

Others don't see it.

Other don't believe us, and they don't have to.

There should be a simple principle or effect that could prove first to us, withough a shred of doubt, the next logical step.

I was thinking in a floating needle in the middle of a container.
    - The density of the fluid could be adjusted to allow free rotation of the needle (need to think what would cause this force... :/ );
    - since it's floating it might be super sensitive to gravity; the liquid should allow very easy movement with almost any resistance;
    - probably we can support the needle on one of its ends, and let it float at an angle;
    - the angle should change if we make it right.

### next steps
* analyze frequencies of data

### Pet Projects:
* Electro Magetic Compass keychain
* Energy generation using our movement relative to the medium
* Energy generation using the hypothesis that light speed changes with a dielectric medium as gravity
